for the backend deployment. backend frmae work : spring boot(java)

1) i have written the docker file to create the image. Image means the application and sofwares dependecies are clubbed together in the form of an image.

2) then the image should be pushed to any registry could be docker hub or ECR ( Elastic continer Registry) we have used ECR ith push commands

3) then create kubernetes cluster and configure the eks cluster and the deploy the image in ecr on to the k8s 

4) to deploy the image on to the k8s we need deployment.yaml and service,yaml

5) deployment.yaml we will mention all the replicas, deployment strategy, image , conatiner and conatiner port , labels

6) service.yaml is used to expose the application to the external world we have 3 types clusterip, nodeport and Loadbalancer

7) we have used ingress as we have mutliple microservices we have used ingress

8) and inorder to change the or set the image we have used kustomize 

9) and to automate this process we have used jenkins and automated each and every step of integrationa dn deployment process

10) to deploy the recenet image we have taken the build number as image tag so that we could deploy the recent image on k8s

11) we also added webhook from the github if something chnaged in the github from the developer side the pipeline will automatcially start the execution 

12) we are using route 53 conacept for the dns congiration . we need to update the all the records after creating the hosted zones in go daddy

13) AND WE SHOULD update the alb end point as A record in the route 53

14) and we are uusing ACM amazon certificate Manager to create SSL certficates and will uodate it in the listern group of theat particulat loda balancer

15)we are using  data dog for monitoring purpose for the  app logs and server mterics like cpu and memory

16) we are using 4 envs in our current project dev qa stage and prod . we are using disiater recovery setup for both qa and stage and we are using us -east and east2 as primary and secondary locations

for fornt end we are using ecs: forntend frame work : reactjs(java script)

17) we are using ecs for the front end so we have created ecs with the task defintions and services

18)in the task definition we need to give the image , along with the tag all the networks , sercutiy groups , replicas , deployment setartegy etc

19) in the service we need to give the alb taregt group and select the task definition which will be auto populated and we should also give the ssl certicate there in the target group to expose the application 

20)we are creating docker file , and creating jenkins to automate the process.
